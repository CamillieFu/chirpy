# Chirpy 🐣💕
<!-- Description -->
Chirpy is a Chrome Extension that works to remove harmful content from Twitter.

Using the Watson API from IBM we are able to get rid of tweets that are deemed too negative.

As well as this, users are able to create their own blacklist of words that they want to be removed.

### Installation
Create an account and download the extension into your browser, then you're good to go.

### Usage
**Need to make some gifs for here.**

### Roadmap
The Chirpy team is planning to extend the usage to other social media sites such as Facebook or Instagram for browsers. But as this is a passion project, we do not have an approximate timeline as of this time.

### Support
Please contact us directly at chirpyapp@gmail.com for any enquiries or questions.

### Contributions
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
